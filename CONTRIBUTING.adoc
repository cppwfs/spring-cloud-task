Spring Cloud Task is released under the Apache 2.0 license. If you would like to contribute something, or want to hack on the code this document should help you get started.


== Using GitHub Issues
We use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancements.
If you have a general usage question please ask on https://stackoverflow.com[Stack Overflow].
The Spring Cloud Task team and the broader community monitor the https://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-cloud-Task[`spring-cloud-task`] tag.

If you are reporting a bug, please help to speed up problem diagnosis by providing as much information as possible.
Ideally, that would include a small sample project that reproduces the problem.



== Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
If you think you have found a security vulnerability in Spring Cloud Task please *DO NOT* disclose it publicly until we've had a chance to fix it.
Please don't report security vulnerabilities using GitHub issues, instead head over to https://spring.io/security-policy and learn how to disclose them responsibly.



== Developer Certificate of Origin
All commits must include a **Signed-off-by** trailer at the end of each commit message to indicate that the contributor agrees to the Developer Certificate of Origin.
For additional details, please refer to the blog post https://spring.io/blog/2025/01/06/hello-dco-goodbye-cla-simplifying-contributions-to-spring[Hello DCO, Goodbye CLA: Simplifying Contributions to Spring].


=== Code Conventions and Housekeeping

None of the following guidelines is essential for a pull request, but they all help your fellow developers understand and work with your code.
They can also be added after the original pull request but before a merge.

* Use the Spring Framework code format conventions. If you use Eclipse, you can import formatter settings by using the `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` file from the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/blob/master/spring-cloud-dependencies-parent/eclipse-code-formatter.xml[Spring Cloud Build] project.
If you use IntelliJ, you can use the https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546[Eclipse Code Formatter Plugin] to import the same file.
* Make sure all new `.java` files have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an  `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph describing the class's purpose.
* Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (to do so, copy it from existing files in the project).
* Add yourself as an `@author` to the .java files that you modify substantially (more than cosmetic changes).
* Add some Javadocs and, if you change the namespace, some XSD doc elements.
* A few unit tests would help a lot as well. Someone has to do it, and your fellow developers appreciate the effort.
* If no one else uses your branch, rebase it against the current master (or other target branch in the main project).
* When writing a commit message, follow https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[these conventions].
If you fix an existing issue, add `Fixes gh-XXXX` (where XXXX is the issue number) at the end of the commit message.
